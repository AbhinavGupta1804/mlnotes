#benefit of 0.0.0.0 as host address are  - #Can be accessed via localhost (127.0.0.1)
#  and the deviceâ€™s local IP (e.g., 192.168.x.x)

#When running a Flask app inside a Docker container,
#you must use 0.0.0.0, or else the app won't be accessible
#from outside the container.   
# 
# 0.0.0.0 allows the server to listen on all network interfaces, 
# making it accessible externally. This is useful for Docker, cloud deployments,
#  and local network access
